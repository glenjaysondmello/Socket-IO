This project demonstrates simple client-server communication using Java sockets. The client sends messages to the server, and the server receives and displays those messages. The connection can be terminated by typing "exit."

# Features
Client: Sends messages to the server.
Server: Receives messages from the client and prints them.
Communication ends when the client sends the message "exit."
