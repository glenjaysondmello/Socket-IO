# Socket-IO
# Java Socket Communication
This project demonstrates simple client-server communication using Java sockets. The client sends messages to the server, and the server receives and displays those messages. The connection can be terminated by typing "exit."

# Features
Client: Sends messages to the server.
Server: Receives messages from the client and prints them.
Communication ends when the client sends the message "exit."
Getting Started
Follow these instructions to run the client-server socket communication on your local machine.

# Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system
Any Java IDE or a text editor
Command-line access for running the program

# Installation
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/glenjaysondmello/Socket-IO.git
cd socket-IO

Use the following commands to compile both the server and client programs:

javac socket_s/server.java
javac socket_c/client.java
    
socket_c/client.java: The client-side code
socket_s/server.java: The server-side code
